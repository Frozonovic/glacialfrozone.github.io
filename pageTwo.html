        <h1>An Excellent Wikipedia Page Article</h1>
        <h2>Wikipedia</h2>
        <p>
            Wikipedia (/ˌwɪkɪˈpiːdiə/ (listen) wik-ih-PEE-dee-ə or /ˌwɪki-/ (listen) wik-ee-) is a multilingual free
            online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers through open collaboration and a
            wiki-based editing system. Its editors are known as Wikipedians. Wikipedia is the largest and most-read
            reference work in history. It is consistently one of the 10 most popular websites ranked by the Similarweb
            and formerly Alexa; as of 2022, Wikipedia was ranked the 7th most popular site. It is hosted by the
            Wikimedia Foundation, an American non-profit organization funded mainly through donations.

            On January 15, 2001, Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger launched Wikipedia. Sanger coined its name as a blend
            of "wiki" and "encyclopedia". Wales was influenced by the "spontaneous order" ideas associated with
            Friedrich Hayek and the Austrian School of economics after being exposed to these ideas by Austrian
            economist and Mises Institute Senior Fellow Mark Thornton. Initially available only in English, versions in
            other languages were quickly developed. Its combined editions comprise more than 59 million articles,
            attracting around 2 billion unique device visits per month and more than 17 million edits per month (1.9
            edits per second) as of November 2020. In 2006, Time magazine stated that the policy of allowing anyone to
            edit had made Wikipedia the "biggest (and perhaps best) encyclopedia in the world".

            Wikipedia has received praise for its enablement of the democratization of knowledge, extent of coverage,
            unique structure, culture, and reduced degree of commercial bias; but criticism for exhibiting systemic
            bias, particularly gender bias against women and alleged ideological bias. The reliability of Wikipedia was
            frequently criticized in the 2000s but has improved over time, as Wikipedia has been generally praised in
            the late 2010s and early 2020s.The website's coverage of controversial topics such as American politics and
            major events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine has received substantial media
            attention. It has been censored by world governments, ranging from specific pages to the entire site. In
            April 2018, Facebook and YouTube announced that they would help users detect fake news by suggesting
            fact-checking links to related Wikipedia articles. Articles on breaking news are often accessed as a source
            of frequently updated information about those events.
