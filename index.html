      Hello! Welcome to my lovely webpage thing? I guess. Something like that. Uhhh... I was told that I can put
      whatever I want here so long as it's GFU approved I guess? I dunno. I'm not very creative. Part of me wants to
      just slap some memes on here and call it good. Probably will. Maybe I'll make a fancy table too. Who knows?
      I certainly don't while writing this. Anywho, if you've made it this far, congratulations. I didn't actually
      expect anyone to read this. I don't even know why I'm still typing it at this point. Maybe I'll stop. Maybe I
      won't. Maybe I'll hide some random fun stuff on this page for you to find. Your guess is as good as mine.

      Well, I guess I'll be nice and give you a bit of background of who I am because why not. So, let's start off with
      this... Hello. My name is Brody. I am a junior computer science major at George Fox. Very interesting. I know.
      Let's get into the actually interesting parts. Considering I have to do a list for this project, what better time
      to do that than now? What you are about to see is something I probably made at like 11:00pm or later because that
      is typically when I do work. Why? I dunno. Anyways, here is a list of my hobbies:
