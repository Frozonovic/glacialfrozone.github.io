      Hello! Welcome to my lovely webpage thing? I guess. Something like that. Uhhh... I was told that I can put
      whatever I want here so long as it's GFU approved I guess? I dunno. I'm not very creative. Part of me wants to
      just slap some memes on here and call it good. Probably will. Maybe I'll make a fancy table too. Who knows?
      I certainly don't while writing this. Anywho, if you've made it this far, congratulations. I didn't actually
      expect anyone to read this. I don't even know why I'm still typing it at this point. Maybe I'll stop. Maybe I
      won't. Maybe I'll hide some random fun stuff on this page for you to find. Your guess is as good as mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I guess I'll be nice and give you a bit of background of who I am because why not. So, let's start off with
      this... Hello. My name is Brody. I'm a junior computer science major at George Fox. Very interesting. I know.
      Let's get into the actually interesting parts. Considering I have to do a list for this project, what better time
      to do that than now? What you're about to see is something I probably made at like 11:00pm or later because that
      is typically when I do work. Why? I dunno. Anyways, here is a list of my hobbies:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Jazz Band
        <ul class="inner">
          <li>Trumpet</li>
          <li>Flugelhorn</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Drum Line
        <ul class="inner">
          <li>Bass Drum</li>
          <li>Snare</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Critical Hit Club (D&D)
        <ul class="inner">
          <li>I'm the president!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Videogames
        <ul class="inner">
          <li>Genshin Impact</li>
          <li>Minecraft</li>
          <li>Rounds</li>
          <li>Apex</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Soccer (when I have time)</li>
      <li>More things that I definitely can't think of because it's like 12:30am</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you have made it to this section, I must say I'm surprised you managed to make it here. Honestly, I'm
      surprised that <em>I</em> made it here. That sure should tell you something. Anyways, not sure what I'm putting
      for the other pages linked to this, but maybe a table? I don't know. We shall see.
    </p>

      Last thing I would like to say is thank you for reading. I do appreciate it as I did take some time out to actually
      create this thing. And personally, I think it looks nice. I like the colour scheme the most. And the photo. It's one
      of my senior photos because I was too lazy to actually get a recent photo and this one happened to be on my LinkedIn
      page. So, that is how this was born. I really didn't have an idea of what I actually wanted to do for this. So,
      my tired self decided this was what was going to happen and I must say it isn't half bad. Go me.
