        <p>
            Welcome to my personal project. Honestly, I'm not sure what to do here. I was originally working on the
            landing page the most and decided to put most of the criteria into that so I'm just gonna pop some stuff in
            here and add some pizazz. Of course, I won't completely destroy your eyeballs. I do have some sort of moral
            understanding of life. Or so I've been told. Have a table:
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Text Stuff</td>
                <td>More Text Stuff</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Another row!</td>
                <td>AND MORE TEXT STUFF!!</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>I'm feeling nice, so you may also have an image after this table:</p>
        <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2a/c6/11/2ac611bd78c297ac5715982c76a0cfa6.jpg" alt="meme">
        <p>And also have...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A</li>
            <li>Fancy</li>
            <li>List</li>
            <li>Made</li>
            <li>Just</li>
            <li>For</li>
            <li>You</li>
        </ul>
        <a></a><h1>Second Page</h1>
        <h1>Third Page</h1>
    </body>
