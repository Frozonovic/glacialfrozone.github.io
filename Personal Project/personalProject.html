            Welcome to my personal project. Honestly, I'm not sure what to do here. I would like to state that the goal
            of this is far from serious. Probably closer to making sure that whoever reads it lets out a chuckle. I was
            originally working on the landing page the most and decided to put most of the criteria into that, so I'm
            just gonna pop some stuff in here and add some pizazz. Feel free to check out the landing page. I think it
            looks nice and I definitely have a good story saying that as well. Of course, I won't completely destroy
            your eyeballs on this page so check it out as well. I do have some sort of moral understanding of life. Or
            so I've been told. Have a table:
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Text Stuff</td>
                <td>More Text Stuff</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Another row!</td>
                <td>AND MORE TEXT STUFF!!</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>I'm feeling nice, so you may also have an image after this table:</p>
        <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2a/c6/11/2ac611bd78c297ac5715982c76a0cfa6.jpg" alt="meme">
        <p>And also have...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A</li>
            <li>Fancy</li>
            <li>List</li>
            <li>Made</li>
            <li>Just</li>
            <li>For</li>
            <li>You</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
